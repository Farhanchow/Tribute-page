    <h2>A paramilitary organization founded by GN technology pioneer and scientist, Aeolia Schenberg</h2>
    <p>The private paramilitary organization Celestial Being, which pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict from Earth was planned and envisioned by its founder, Schenberg 200 years prior to it becoming fully functional. 
      The main objective of Celestial Being's activities was to completely eliminate acts of war from this world by means of amred interventions.
      The organization established under the ideology of ending global conflict using a line of revolutionary mobile weapons known as 'Gundams'. These mobile weapons operated under GN drives, which were made with GN particles. These Gundam Nucleus (GN)particles are exotic particles created from years of experimentation of electromagentic waves and gravity. GN particles are prominently used as part of an electromagnetic radar-disruption stealth measure, a physical barrier, GN Vernier propellant, and a particle coating that enhances both the sharpness (aka. cutting ability) of physical blades and the durability of armor.  
      Celestial Being utilized the whole GN technology to develop these movile weapons for the sole purpose of to rid ourselves of the scourge of war. Their philosophy was openly stated during their debut by the declaration to all humanity. Territory, religion, energy no matter what the reason or excuse if there is an evident act of war being carried out, Celestial Being would commence intervention with their force. Any country, organization or corporation that promotes war were a legitimate target for their intervention.
